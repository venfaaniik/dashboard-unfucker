Cool idea to push posts to the user's dash! Especially about a subject as important as that! But how about don't!

# dashboard-unfucker
Unfucks the twitterification of tumblr's dashboard by reverting it to the old layout as closely as possible while also offering control over other aspects of the UI.

## Installation
The script works with and is fully tested with Tampermonkey, Tampermonkey Beta, Greasemonkey, and Violentmonkey.
- Install any one of the script injector extensions listed above.
- Click on [unfucker.user.js](https://github.com/enchanted-sword/dashboard-unfucker/raw/main/unfucker.user.js) to install or update.
- NOTE: if you are updating from a version that ends in "b" (the no-flags version), the script will be installed separately instead of overwriting the existing script because they have different `@name` properties. You should disable or delete the old version of the script, as having both enabled will cause unintended behaviour.


## Features
The script uses window property flags to completely disable the vertical navigation layout, as well as Tumblr Live, the Tumblr Shop, and Tumblr Domains.
By default, it also reverts the latest activity, messaging, and searchbar updates, as well as removing the "post without tags?" popup in the post editor and re-adding the number of unread posts to the corner of the "home" icon in the navbar.

The features of the script are fully customizable in the sidebar config menu (the gear icon).

### Show hidden NSFW posts in the timeline
Certain posts flagged as NSFW by Tumblr are delivered by internal API requests, but are not added to the dashboard feed. Enabling this feature will make these posts visible on the dashboard.

## Troubleshooting
- Not fully tested on chromium or safari, but sources seem to say that it does work as intended.
- If it injects, but ends up wonky, chances are you just need to do a full reload of the page (ctrl + shift + r).
- If you've updated script versions but it doesn't fix a version-specific bug, it's likely because of browser caching, closing and reopening the browser usually fixes it.
- If the inbox navigation icon isn't showing up, remove any custom adblock filters that you were previously using to hide the live/shop/etc. icons.

## Known issues / Incompatibilities
- The script apparently conflicts with HTTPS Everywhere extension on Firefox.
- The script may conflict with Legacy & New XKit. However, it works just fine with XKit Rewritten.
- The header may rarely appear larger than normal. The exact cause of this is not known, but it seems to be fixed permanently by just searching something in the searchbar.
